// TrackBroadcaster efficiently distributes RTP packets from a single remote track
// to multiple subscriber peer connections. It implements the core SFU (Selective
// Forwarding Unit) functionality by reading packets once and writing them to many peers.
//
// Key features:
//   - Single goroutine reads from the remote track continuously
//   - Concurrent writes to subscribers using goroutine pool with semaphore
//   - Automatic subscriber removal on write errors
//   - Clean shutdown via context cancellation
//   - Thread-safe subscriber management using sync.Map
//
// Performance considerations:
//   - Uses a semaphore (maxConcurrentWrites=20) to limit concurrent write goroutines
//   - Prevents overwhelming the system with too many simultaneous writes
//   - Each write is non-blocking for other subscribers
//
// The broadcaster is created when a track arrives from a publisher and runs
// until Stop() is called or the remote track ends.

// NewTrackBroadcaster creates a new broadcaster for the given remote track.
// It initializes a local track that mirrors the remote track's properties
// and starts a goroutine to continuously read and broadcast RTP packets.
//
// The local track:
//   - Uses the same codec as the remote track
//   - Uses the same track ID and stream ID
//   - Can be added to multiple subscriber peer connections
//
// Parameters:
//   - remoteTrack: The track to read RTP packets from (from the publisher)
//   - publisherSocketID: Socket ID of the publisher, used for logging
//
// Returns an error if local track creation fails (rare, usually config issue).

// broadcastLoop is the main loop that reads RTP packets from the remote track

//  1. Reads an RTP packet from the remote track (blocks until packet arrives)
//  2. Calls broadcastToSubscribers to write the packet to all subscribers
//  3. Continues until context is cancelled or remote track ends
//
// If reading fails (remote track closed, network error, etc.), the loop exits
// and logs the error. The broadcaster should then be stopped and cleaned up.

// broadcastToSubscribers writes an RTP packet to all subscriber peer connections concurrently.
// It uses a goroutine pool pattern with a semaphore to limit concurrency and prevent
// system overload when there are many subscribers.
//
// The broadcast strategy:
//  1. Iterate through all subscribers in the sync.Map
//  2. For each subscriber, spawn a goroutine to write the packet
//  3. Use a semaphore (maxConcurrentWrites=20) to limit concurrent writes
//  4. Wait for all writes to complete before returning
//  5. Remove subscribers that fail to write (disconnected/closed)
//
// Concurrency control:
//   - Maximum 20 concurrent write operations at once
//   - Prevents exhausting goroutine pool with thousands of subscribers
//   - Each write is independent - slow subscribers don't block others
//
// Error handling:
//   - If a write fails, that subscriber is removed from the map
//   - This handles disconnected peers without explicit notification
//   - Other subscribers continue receiving packets normally
//
// The method blocks until all writes complete, ensuring packet ordering
// is maintained for the next packet broadcast.

// Parameters:
//   - data: The RTP packet data to broadcast (already sliced to actual length)
